# Elf Example with React and Angular

This project was generated to demonstrate a problem I am seeing with useObservable in the react project.

## Running the applications

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- Run the Angular Project 
  - `npm run start-angular`
- Run the React Project
  - `npm run start-react`
